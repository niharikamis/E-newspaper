<div id="art1" class="article"><span class="tit">3D-Printed 'Lego' Bricks Could Bend Sound into Acoustic Holograms</span><br>3D-printed bricks that look like Lego pieces could provide a simple, low-cost way of creating acoustic holograms — 3D shapes and 
structures made of sound — for applications as varied as entertainment, medicine or wireless charging, according to a recent study.

Anyone who's watched "Star Wars" will be familiar with the concept of an optical hologram — a 3D image that floats in midair — though real-life 
technology is significantly less advanced than what was portrayed on-screen.

Holograms are effectively a recording of a 3D light field that can project a reproduction of the original object when lit properly. 
(The term hologram can refer to both the recording medium and the resulting projection.) The hologram concept can be applied to sound waves 
to create acoustic holograms, though this field of research is still very new, according to the scientists who developed this new method.

<div id="art2" class="article"><span class="tit">You Can 3D Print Your Own Mini Universe</span><br>Have you ever wondered what the universe looks 
like in all of its entirety, or how it would feel to hold the universe in the palm of your hand? Good news: It is now possible to do both of these
 things — all you need is a 3D printer.

Researchers at the Imperial College London have created the blueprints for 3D printing the universe, and have provided the instructions online so 
anyone with access to a 3D printer can print their own miniature universe. You can see a video on the science behind the 3D-printed universe here.

The researchers' representation of the universe specifically depicts the cosmic microwave background (CMB), or a glowing light throughout the 
universe that is thought to be leftover radiation from the Big Bang, when the universe was born about 13.8 billion years ago.

<div id="art3" class="article"><span class="tit">A.I. 'Nightmare Machine' Knows What Scares You</span><br>The idea of artificial intelligence (AI)
 — autonomous computers that can learn independently — makes some people extremely uneasy, regardless of what the computers in question might be doing.

Those individuals probably wouldn't find it reassuring to hear that a group of researchers is deliberately training computers to get better at scaring
 people witless.

The project, appropriately enough, is named "Nightmare Machine." Digital innovators in the U.S. and Australia partnered to create an algorithm that 
would enable a computer to understand what makes certain images frightening, and then use that data to transform any photo, no matter how 
harmless-looking, into the stuff of nightmares.

<div id="art4" class="article"><span class="tit">Bomb-Sniffing Bionic Plants Could Look for Pollution</span><br>Bionic plants that can detect 
explosives in real time could be the future of environmental monitoring and urban farming, researchers said in a new study.

The spinach plants have carbon-nanotube-based nanoparticles in their leaves that give off infrared light and are sensitive to the presence of 
nitroaromatics, key components of several explosives, the scientists said.

If these chemicals are present in groundwater, they are absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves, where they cause the infrared 
emissions of the so-called "nanosensor" to decrease. [In Photos: World's Most Polluted Places]

A detector that is similar in complexity to a smartphone can then register this change in emissions, the researchers said. In tests with the 
nitroaromatic picric acid, this dip was detected within 10 minutes of the roots taking up the chemical, according to the study, published today 
(Oct. 31) in the journal Nature Materials.

The researchers said their "nanobionic" approach is much faster than previous genetic engineering methods that rely on monitoring changes like 
wilting or de-greening that can take hours or days and aren't easy to detect electronically. The scientists also used a wild breed of spinach 
rather than special lab-grown varieties. The researchers said they are confident they can replicate the method with a broad range of plant species 
that are well-adapted to their environments.

"Genetic engineering is very powerful, but in practice there are only a handful of plants where this can be done. We can take a plant in your 
backyard and easily engineer it" using nanobionics instead of genetics, said study leader Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
