<div id="prague" class="big">
	<span class="header" id="prh" >PRAGUE</span>
	<div class="image" id="pri"></div>
	<div class="about" id="pra">One of Europe’s best-preserved cities, Prague has a romantic riverside location enhanced by graceful bridges 
	and a magnificent skyline punctuated with medieval church spires. Its historic Old Town follows a plan laid out 1,000 years ago, 
	with ancient squares and winding cobblestone streets. Haunting Prague Castle looms large across the Vltava River, rising above the 
	exquisite Charles Bridge. Add extravagant, fairy-tale architecture;memorable classical music; and, these days, good food and drink, 
	and it’s easy to see why Prague charms everyone who visits.<br></div>

<div id="edinburgh" class="big">
	<span class="header" id="edh">EDINBURGH</span>
	<div class="image" id="edi"></div>
	<div class="about" id="eda">Edinburgh is one of Europe’s most beautiful cities, draped across a series of rocky hills overlooking the sea. 
	It’s a town intimately entwined with its landscape, with buildings and monuments perched atop crags and overshadowed by cliffs – in the words 
	of Robert Louis Stevenson, ‘a dream in masonry and living rock’. From the Old Town’s picturesque jumble of medieval tenements piled high along 
	the Royal Mile, its turreted skyline strung between the black, bull-nosed Castle Rock and the russet palisade of Salisbury Crags, to the
	New Town’s neat grid of neoclassical respectability, the city offers a constantly changing perspective.

<div id="frankfurt" class="big">
	<span class="header" id="frh">FRANKFURT</span>
	<div class="image" id="fri"></div>
	<div class="about" id="fra">Glinting with glass, steel and concrete skyscrapers, Frankfurt-on-the-Main (pronounced ‘mine’) is unlike any other
	German city. The focal point of a conurbation of 5.5 million inhabitants, ‘Mainhattan’ is a high-powered finance and business hub, home to one 
	of the world’s largest stock exchanges as well as the gleaming new headquarters of the European Central Bank. Frankfurt famously hosts some of 
	the world's most important trade fairs, attracting thousands of business travellers. Its airport, the region’s biggest employer, is the 
	third-largest in Europe, handling over 57 million passengers per year.<br>
Yet at its heart, Frankfurt is an unexpectedly traditional and charming city, with half-timbered buildings huddled in its quaint medieval 
Altstadt (old city), cosy apple wine taverns serving hearty regional food, village-like neighbourhoods filled with outdoor cafes, boutiques 
and street art, and beautiful parks, gardens and riverside paths. The city's cache of museums is second in Germany only to Berlin’s, and its
 nightlife and entertainment scenes are bolstered by a spirited student population.

<div id="florida" class="big">
	<span class="header" id="evh">EVERGLADES</span>
	<div class="image" id="evi"></div>
	<div class="about" id="eva">There is no wilderness in America quite like the Everglades. Called the ‘River of Grass’ by its initial Native 
	American inhabitants, this is not just a wetland, or a swamp, or a lake, or a river, or a prairie, or a grassland – it is all of the above,
	twisted together into a series of soft horizons, long vistas, sunsets that stretch across your entire field of vision and the creeping grin 
	of a large population of dinosaur-era reptiles.<br>
When you watch anhinga flexing their wings before breaking into a corkscrew dive, or the slow, Jurassic flap of a great blue heron gliding over 
its domain, or the sun kissing miles of unbroken saw grass as it sets behind humps of skeletal cypress domes, you’ll have an idea of what we’re 
speaking of. In a nation where natural beauty is measured by its capacity for drama, the Everglades subtly, contentedly flows on.
